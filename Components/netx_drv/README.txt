Introduction
------------

This is the driver library, designated for the netX microcontroller application side.
This page will provide an overview of the driver and explain how it is structured and 
how it is used. The target IDE of this introduction and the driver itself is netX Studio.

The CMSIS component is also used and explained here. In future versions both components
will be merged together.

Features and requirements of the driver
-----------------------
The target of the driver layer is to provide a simple API for the applications to 
interact with the devices available. We have two kinds of drivers. The first one are the
ones we have developed after the CMSIS recommendations. The other ones are developed for
verification purposes and provide a hardware near abstaction layer. To support the family of 
chips a so called chip support layer was introduced, where the drivers functionality is
mapped to requirement definitons and of course the hardware registers.  

This meta layer shall met the following requirements:
- The API shall be user friendly.
- There shall be no dynamic memory allocation.
- The API shall have a consistent look and feel.
- The driver should be performant but shall also be maintainable.
- For security reasons the drivers API shall only return elements of the state
    enumeration.
- The CMSIS standard has to be respected and be a general guideline.
  - Changes on it shall be minimal.
  - A pack shall be available in the future and contain the flasher.
  - The svd and all other structures shall be supported and used by the driver.
- The driver uses the object oriented c as a guideline.
  - The first parameter shall be the associated class/handle/context object.
  - If the context object is global and constant it should not be necessary to
      be the first parameter.
  - The definition of functions as function pointers and object attributes is
      optional.
  - There should not be the need for inheritance.
- The driver shall support operating systems.
- The functions shall be reentrant.
- The driver shall support concurrent acesses.
  - A locking mechanisms shall be implemented and used therefore
- The driver shall contain debug tracing functionality
- The data and control flow shall be separated as good as possible.
  - A flusing function shall be introduced to cope with the data flow.
  - There shall be IRQ, DMAC and Polling programing models be implemented
      for each device driver.
- The driver is configured via the configuration object. It may not be 
    modified except by driver.
- The drivers context object or handle shall not be modified exept by
    driver.
- A driver is referenced to an other driver by its handle.
- Blocking calls shall implement a timeout.
- Blocking calls shall provide a sleep and rescheduling option.
- There shall be callbacks available.
- DeInit shall deactivate the peripheral module from an application point of view. 
    (e.g. disable interrupts, stop DMA, etc.) It is not required to reset 
    HW registers to reset state.

Structure of the driver
-----------------------
To illustrate the structure of the driver an example device driver "DEV" is discussed. The naming 
convention and other ones will be discussed in the next chapter called "Conventions".

### Operation modes
Most of our peripherals are communication devices or deliver an data stream of some kind. Those streams
are in most concepts transmitting and receiving data in single-, half- or full-duplex. To increase the
maintainability the data and the control flows are split up as good as possible. To transport the data,
the dma is used or the flush routine for transmitting the data. All other functions have the job to
configure, initiate and control the flow of data. 

### Layers
In the layer model below one is able to see its over all structure. At the top there is an application 
and in the bottom, the hardware peripherals are shown.
<table>
<tr><th colspan="7">Application
<tr><td rowspan="5">CMSIS, OS abstaction<BR>and helper functions<td rowspan="5">DRV_DEV_GetState/<BR>DRV_DEV_Init<td rowspan="2" colspan="2">DRV_DEV_Abort<td>DRV_DEV_Tx<td>DRV_DEV_Rx<td>DRV_DEV_TxRx
<tr><td colspan="3" >CallByControlFlow
<tr><td rowspan="3">DMA<td rowspan="3">IRQ<td rowspan="2">Poll<td>IRQ<td>DMA
<tr><td>ISR<td rowspan="2">DMA ISR
<tr><td colspan="2">Flush
<tr><th colspan="7">Hardware Device/NVIC/DMAC
</table>
Between the application and the hardware are on the upper layer the API calls. Some are directly interacting
with the hardware like the initialization and some are not. The get state for example derives hardware states
and software states in one call. The init function for example talks also with the NVIC peripheral and the 
dmac to initialize the drivers context by its given configuration. The abort function is split between the
dma and irq mode but for polling it is not necessary, because in polling it is not possible to abort the
polling context. To centralize the control flow and to switch between data direction and operation method 
there is a special layer. That configures the data flow parameters and then calls the associated operation
method. This is done, because in most cases, the operation mode is independent of the data flow configured.

### Configuration file
The driver is configured by a configuration file. This file is called netx_drv_user_conf.h, which is derived
from its template called netx_drv_user_conf_template.h.

The configuration file may be used to include components of the driver into the build process or not, without
managing the inclusion inside waf and the sources. This may be performed my commenting out or in the enabled
macros.

It is also used for the os specific parts of the driver, where it is possible to exchange the api locking with the
os free mutexes against os specific ones.

Because the DMA is used by some other drivers it has to be included if those are used. The same will be necessary
for the SQI-Flash driver with the SQI driver. 

### OS abstraction layer for the driver
The os abstraction layer currently exists solely by the locking mechanism of the API. If a context is already in
use, the locking mechanism shall prevent two callers from using the same context. Two callers for example might
be on the netX90 two tasks of an operating system or the normal execution context (user mode) and the interrupt
context (privileged mode).

### Errors, states and assertion

### Class diagram of example device "DEV"
In the diagram below, one is able to take a look on the general structure of drivers.
The first attribute of all function calls shall contain a pointer to the structure
containing the execution context. The only exception of this are the DIO driver, that
has a global context objet and the legacy hardware abstraction layer drivers.

\enddot
The handle structure associated with the device consists out of the configuration,
other attributes and a set of functions. The attributes shall not be altered, except
the configuration, which shall be provided before (re)initializing the driver. So it
is possible to change configuration parameters afterwards, but they have to be
followed by an initialization. This has a lot of side effects and should only be 
performed if really necessary. The change of operation mode by reinitilization is
particularly not recommended at the moment, because of its huge test vector.

In case that a subdevice is used, such as the dma controller, one has to provide
a context handle.

### Usage of the API
The driver has the legacy HALs that are not part of this structure, also the dio driver
is a bit special. The DIO has a global handle, that is not visible to the user. This design
choice was made, because the devices have no interleaved configuration and no higher context.
Each channel (pin) has a well defined state so that it is not necessary to provide context
sensitive informations between interactions.

The normal API however has some core functions. As already used in the class diagram above,
we define a device called DEV by functionalities as init, deinit, transmit, receive, change, 
abort and at last get state. All methods return the state of the drivers api. In c peudo
code, such a device interaction is shown. The example is some kind of spi device, where the
chip or frame select line is set before and reset after a transmission.

\code{.c}
typedef DRV_SPI_HANDLE_T;
typedef DRV_STATUS_E;
typedef DRV_SPI_FSS_E;

DRV_STATUS_E DRV_SPI_Init(DRV_SPI_HANDLE_T * const ptHandle);
DRV_STATUS_E DRV_SPI_DeInit(DRV_SPI_HANDLE_T * const ptHandle);
DRV_STATUS_E DRV_SPI_Transmit(DRV_SPI_HANDLE_T * const ptHandle, uint8_t* pcData, size_t size);
DRV_STATUS_E DRV_SPI_Receive(DRV_SPI_HANDLE_T * const ptHandle, uint8_t* pcData, size_t size);
DRV_STATUS_E DRV_SPI_ChangeFss(DRV_SPI_HANDLE_T * const ptHandle, DRV_SPI_FSS_E eFSS);
DRV_STATUS_E DRV_SPI_GetState(DRV_SPI_HANDLE_T * const ptHandle);

DRV_SPI_HANDLE_T ptHandle;
\endcode

### Buffers: data and control flows
The data and the control instructions are split up into several contexts. While the data and the
control instructions originate from the same source, they should be split up as early as possible
and executed by different (meta) contexts. Those conexts and the execution Sequence of the 

### Polling mode
The polling mode of an driver is intended to give the user a mode where the device is acessed in 
high priority by the core to exchange data. This means, that the caller context is blocked and its
primary task is to flush the buffers. In the sequence diagram below one can see how this behaviour
is achieved.

### Error Handling
The following code snipped is an example code on how to make use of the returned state. Not every DRV_STATE_E differing from DRV_OK is an error.
A good example might be the DRV_LOCKED state, which might occur because an interrupt interrupted the allocation of the locking mutex. If this
has happened one has to try again locking it. However, the API might also be locked and another task is using it. So it is feasible to log the
time or count how often this happens and decide at wich point this might be an error.

Conventions
-----------
We would like to give an introduction in the conventions used in this library.

### Naming
As a naming convention we will use a namespacing scheme. Every driver call or data
type will be prefixed with "DRV_" and the files with "netx_drv_". After those prefixes
the next part will be the drivers module name like "DRV_SPI", which is in this case the
SPI module.
#### Files
All files shall be prefixed by "netx_drv". Thus for example the spi driver would be named netx_drv_spi.
The suffix shall suffice the language requirements. So C source files are suffixed with ".c" and the headers
with ".h". In the case of C++ the sources are suffixed with ".cpp" and the headers with ".hpp".
Assembler files with ".S" or ".s". The CMSIS SVD file has the suffix ".svd" and documentations end with
".txt". The waf script is without any suffix and named unique by folder as wscript.
#### Devices
After the drivers prefix DRV_ the device is specified with a short naming in capital letters DRV_DEV
#### Enumerations
The enumerations will all be prefixed with DRV_ and then followed by the device for which they are defined.
Then the name of the enumeration is given in capital letters  DRV_DEV_ENUM_E 
#### Definitions
DRV_DEV_SOMETHING
#### Structures
struct DRV_DEV_STRUCT_Ttag

DRV_DEV_STRUCT_T
#### CMSIS and device header
__NVIC and so on.
#### Functions
DRV_DEV_Init
#### Variables
enum eVariableValue

### Documentation
There shall be documentation everywhere
#### Files
At the beginning. The doxygen grouping. Disclaimer
#### Types
Before the types definition. Each structure or enum element
#### Functions
Before the function in the header brief with member of and
in the source detailled with member of, params return and
visibility.

### Code Formatting

Memory Model
------------
The drivers are designed in the way that a caller is able to allocate the context
handle on its stack. The drivers do not allocate memory on themselfs. Also the drivers
API is protected with an os free mutex implementation for locking. This of course
might be exchanged with operating system functions. So in drivers default, it is always
possible to analyze the used stack memory with call graphs.

Compiling the driver
--------------------
The driver has a file called user_drv_conf_template.h which shall be copied/renamed to
user_drv_conf.h and modified. The driver has to be build without any extra parameters 
necessary. The CMSIS compliant device description header files and starting code has 
to be used. In the templates and Examples provided from hilscher are waf scripts.
Those scripts contain the script parts necessary for compiling the driver.

The driver component depends on the CMSIS component and both shall be used together.

In the waf scripts we recommend the following compiler options:
\code{.ld}
__STACK_SIZE = 0x00002000 
__HEAP_SIZE =  0x00002000

defines = ["__STACK_SIZE = %u" % __STACK_SIZE,
           "__HEAP_SIZE = %u" % __HEAP_SIZE,
           "__STARTUP_CLEAR_BSS",
           "__START = main",
           ]
\endcode

Linking the program
-------------------
The example linker scripts are available in the CMSIS folder.

Documentation
-------------
Documentation in HTML-format can be generated by using <B>doxygen</B>.
A respective <EM>Doxyfile</EM> is part of this example. You can run doxygen from command line
or from inside <EM>netX Studio CDT</EM>. The output will be created in folder <EM>Doc</EM>.

### netX Studio CDT
Just click on @ symbol at menu bar and choose Doxyfile.
At the first time using this, <EM>netX Studio CDT</EM>
will ask for installing Doxygen and Graphviz, which have to be installed.

### Command line
Just execute <code>doxygen</code> from command line in the root directory of this example.
It is required to have doxygen.exe in the PATH. If the "graphviz" package is installed,
the documentation contains visual dependency diagrams.
Due to a bug in dogygen, it is necessary to specify the path to dot.exe (Graphviz)
in the "Doxyfile" -> DOT_PATH parameter

\note The doxygen documentation requires doxygen version 1.8.0. or higher in order to 
support Markdown plain text formatting
\note The doxygen tag INCLUDE_PATH has to be set to include the correct user_drv_conf.h to 
generate the documentation properly.
